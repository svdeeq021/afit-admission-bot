# ðŸŽ“ AFIT Admission Assistant

An intelligent, **AI-powered chatbot** built with **Streamlit** and **Groq's free Llama 3.1 API**, designed to assist prospective students of the **Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), Kaduna** with accurate and structured information about **admission requirements, available programmes, fees, deadlines, and general inquiries**.

---

## ðŸ§  Overview

The **AFIT Admission Assistant** combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **LLM reasoning** to provide context-aware answers to admission-related questions.

Instead of generating random text, the bot searches through a structured **knowledge base** containing official AFIT data, extracts relevant sections, and feeds them to the Groq AI model to generate clean, human-readable answers.

This ensures that all responses are:
- **Accurate** â€” grounded in verified AFIT data.
- **Concise** â€” clearly explained without jargon.
- **Contextual** â€” based only on relevant information.
- **Reliable** â€” avoids hallucination or speculation.
